## ⚡ Overview

**Turbo-Skryer** is the visual companion to the Turbo-TOSEC ingestion tool. It allows retro enthusiasts to browse, search, and filter millions of ROM entries with zero latency.

It is the first implementation of the **Skryer Engine**, a specialized visualization architecture developed by Depones Labs to bridge the gap between Big Data backends and desktop user experiences.

## ✨ The Skryer Technology

At the heart of this application lies the **Skryer Engine**, a custom virtualization stack built on **DuckDB** and **Qt (PySide6)**.

* **🚀 Virtualized Grids:** Instead of loading data into RAM, Skryer implements a "Sliding Window" cache mechanism. Whether you have 10,000 or 1,000,000 rows, the application only consumes memory for what is currently visible on screen.
* **🧠 Asynchronous Querying:** Search operations are debounced and executed on separate threads, ensuring the UI remains responsive at 60 FPS even during heavy filtering.
* **🛡️ Read-Only Architecture:** Skryer treats your data lakes as immutable artifacts, preventing accidental corruption.
